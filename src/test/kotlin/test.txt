My Python Examples.
Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written. I do not consider myself a programmer, I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.
In the scripts the comments etc are lined up correctly when they are viewed in Notepad++. This is what I use to code Python scripts.
    batch_file_rename.py - This will batch rename a group of files in a given directory, once you pass the current and new extensions.
    create_dir_if_not_there.py - Checks to see if a directory exists in the users home directory, if not then create it.
    Fast Youtube Downloader - Downloads youtube videos fastly with parallel threads using aria2c
    Google Image Downloader - Query the specific term and retrieve the images from google image database.
    dir_test.py - Tests to see if the directory testdir exists, if not it will create the directory for you.
    env_check.py - This script will check to see if all of the environment variables I require are set.
